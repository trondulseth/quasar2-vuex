# Quasar App (quasar2-test)

A Quasar Framework app trying to implement a enterprise way of structuring code inspired by: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/building-vue-enterprise-application-part-0-overture-6d41bea14236

I've added the following folders in src:

- entities
  - user
- services
  - user
- store

  - user

  It is the store part where I am currently a bit stuck.

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
